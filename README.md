# Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA)

## About
This program is designed to solve multi-objective problems using Genetic Algorithms. In this example, I give an example of liquor fermentation data in array type with fermentation day values ​​with day units starting from 7 days to 1825 (5 years) and price values ​​with rupiah units starting from Rp.100,000 to Rp.5,000,000. This program will find the longest fermentation day (max) with the lowest price (min)
